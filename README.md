# Decrypt Overwatch Strings
String decryption for blizzard's string encryption, tested on specifically overwatch, if you make any improvements, open a PR.

Note that this is a python script is for IDA Pro. 

I will under **no circumstances** provide support for you, the script is provided **as is**.

I have **not** tested this on other blizzard titles, the patterns may not be the same, so if you want to use it on another game, you may have to change them.
