# decrypt_blizzard_strings
String decryption for blizzard strings, tested on overwatch, if you make any improvements, open a PR.
Note that this script is for IDA Pro, and should be used on a **dumped** version of the game. 
I will under **no circumstances** provide support for you, or explain how to dump the game, the script is provided **as is**.
I have **not** tested this on other blizzard titles, the patterns may not be the same, so if you want to use it on another game, you may have to change them.
